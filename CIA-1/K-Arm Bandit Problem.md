# K-Arm Bandit Recommendation System

## Problem Statement

To design a recommendation system using the K-Arm bandit framework.  
This recommendation system has multiple items, and each time a user interacts with the system, an item should be recommended. Over time, the system should learn which are preferred and adjust its recommendations accordingly. The goal is to model a trade-off between exploring and exploiting.  

For the K-Arm bandit problem where the system must balance exploration and exploitation, one solution is the epsilon-greedy method – an approach to handle the trade-off.  
The system has K items (arms), and each item has an unknown probability. Each time the system recommends an item, it observes whether the recommendation was successful (reward of 1) or not (reward of 0)). The goal is to maximise the cumulative rewards (successful recommendations) by finding the item with the highest recommendation probability.

## 1. Defining the arms i.e. recommendations:
In the context of a recommendation system, each arm represents a recommendation.  
Eg: a movie to watch, a product to buy, a magazine to reach, a song to listen  

## 2. Defining the rewards:
The reward of each arm corresponds to user feedback after the item is recommended.  
Eg: click-through rate = CTR (if the user clicked on the item), time spent - how long did the user engage with the item, purchase: did the user buy the product, download: did the user download the product  

## 3. Exploration and Exploitation trade-off:
The core of the K-arm bandit problem is balancing between exploitation – recommending items that have already shown good results or yielded high rewards and exploration – recommending less-explored items to learn more about user preferences.

Using the epsilon-greedy method: exploration occurs with probability ε where the system randomly selects an item to gather information about lesser-known items and exploitation occurs with probability 1-ε where the system selects items with the highest known reward rate to maximise rewards.  
ε is the parameter that controls the degree of exploration. It usually starts high and decays over time as the system learns more.  

## Implementation:

1. **Initialisation:** Initialise estimates of rewards for each arm (recommendations)  
2. **Recommendations:** Based on the algorithm chosen (Epsilon-greedy algorithm) select an item to recommend.  
3. **Feedback collection:** Observe the reward from the user based on either interaction with a recommended item.  
4. **Update:** Update the estimated reward for the selected arm  
5. **Repeat:** Repeat this process for a sequence of users or recommendations.  

## Advantages of using the Epsilon Greedy method for the problem at hand:

- It efficiently balances exploration and exploitation  
- Has the ability to adapt dynamically to changing user preferences over time.  
- Can handle large item sets by focusing the recommendations on the required items.
